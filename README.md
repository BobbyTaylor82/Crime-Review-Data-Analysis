# Deep Data Dive of Crime in Austin

Our goal was to take an in-depth analysis into the crimes occurring in Austin, Texas. In addition to the overall crime spread of our city, we wanted to discover correlations between the Travis County zip codes and the demographics behind the crimes. 

#### But... why?

Because even though Austin is a pretty cool place, there are dusty corners and dark alleyways that we wanted to explore. For data!

# The Code
We utilized the jupyter notebook and Python 3.6 to create our DataFrames and coerce our data to tell us a story.
